# Disk migration - Move to a new disk

- Use clonezilla to clone the drive
- In the new booted linux system, use gparted to extend the encrypted partition
- After that you need to resize the lvm volume which is part of the encrypted partition, to do so:

```
sudo lvdisplay # This is to get the mountpoint, although it usually is /dev/vg/root
sudo lvextend â€“l +100%FREE [MOUNTPOINT]
sudo resize2fs [MOUNTPOINT]
```

The new disk will have the new size of the disk
